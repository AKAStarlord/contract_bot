NOTE: THE GENERAL FANAGER PUBLIC API DOES NOT EXIST YET. PROGRESS OF THIS PROJECT IS STILL PENDING.

This bot is intended to use the General Fanager public API to serve user requests on www.reddit.com/r/hockey using PRAW to communicate to the Reddit API.

Please do all development into the Development branch. Development will be merged into Master only for version releases.

I'm brand new to Python so feel free to correct any of my poor coding conventions that I'm sure are littered througout this project.

Testing of the bot should be done on our testing subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/contractbottestbed/
